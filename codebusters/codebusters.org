I found a good practice test online that has an explanation of the solutions for harder problems, it's in the practice_tests directory labelled *practice_with_explanations.pdf*. You can also find it [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D3jN489fuNuuHg_8pqMtCI-S0A2Wjjom][here]] under the file *Codebusters.pdf*
